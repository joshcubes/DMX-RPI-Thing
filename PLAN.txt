PLAN

So far, the idea is to use a Raspberry Pi 0 W
    - Has Wifi
    - Has GPIO
    - Inexpensive
Then, I'm going to attepmt to make an Art-Net to DMX converter and then attempt to run this through the GPIO pins on the pi.
From reaserch it might be neccasary to use a voltage booster or something different to provide the full voltage which the DMX spec requires idk about this though needs testing.
If I do need this I'm probably going to an arduino or somthing like that because I already have it on hand.

1: Initial Idea probably going to be written in python then if it needs speed I'll rewrite it in something else.
2: Might run a simple lighting console through an oscilloscope to capture packets.
